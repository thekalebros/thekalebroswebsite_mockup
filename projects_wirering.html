                 <h2>Handmade Wire Damascus Ring</h2>

                 <p><strong>Let's make a ring! <strong></p>
                    <p>First, we need some material, I thought some sort of damascus would be fun. After a quick look around a scrap yard I found some choice Wire Rope with my name all over it!</p>
                    
                    <img src="Photos/wirerope_1.jpg" width="1100">

                    <p>After cutting it into manageable lengths, I pulled apart the individual strands. Sometimes it's fun to mix and match different steels in the rope.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/wirerope_2.jpg" width="1100">
                    <p>I ended up replacing the center strand with a solid rod of some sort. Let's see how th epattern turns out!</p>

                    <p>Next I wrap it back up and tack weld the ends to help keep it together. May as well stick a handle on while we're at it.</p>
                    <img src="Photos/wirerope_4.jpg" width="1100">

                    <p>Finally we can put it to some heat! I start by softly tapping the strands together, then I put secure it in a vise and twist it down on itself. </p>

                    <p>Once i am satisfied, i section it into quarters and tack weld them together.</p>

                    <img src="Photos/wirerope_6.jpg" width="1100">

                    <p>Once they are welded up to eachother, I have my material! </p>

                    <img src="Photos/wirerope_7.jpg" width="1100">
                    <p>hew, lot's of work just for a hunk of metal eh?</p>

                    <img src="Photos/keychain_1.jpg" width="1100">
                    <p>Here is a cross section of the billet so far. I simply cut sections off the billet for various projects. Pictured here is a keychain as a sample</p>
                    <p>Not good enough welds for a knife, perfect for a ring. The larger "grey" areas in the pattern is the  solid strand I added in. I think it came out pretty fun!</p>

                    <p>After boring a hole through the center of a section, into the fire it goes!</p>
                    <img src="Photos/ring_2.jpg" width="1100">

                    <p>Using progressively larger hole punches, I widen the initial hole in the billet.</P>

                    <p>Once I have reached my desired size, it's time to clean it up.</p>
                    <img src="Photos/ring_4.jpg" width="1100">
                    <p>After an excessive amount of filing, sanding, and polishing, we give it a spring temper.</p>
