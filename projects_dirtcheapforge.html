                 <h2>Home made burner/brick forge</h2>

                 <p><strong>Quick and dirty (HOT!) forge/burner example I threw together recently. For a first time metal worker, I typically recommend you start with a regular Propane burner assembly. However, once you've outgrown these options, here's how one might "level up" for cheap.<strong></p>

                 <p><strong> If I remember correctly, I spent about $50 on these componants. Perhaps i'll dig out those reciepts one of these days...</strong></p>

                 <p><strong>I went with 1/4" steel tube, with a reducer to 1/8" pipe for the jet.</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Detail of the drilling a hole to act as our jet. I believe it was a 1/64" drill bit. I figured if I drilled it out too big, I could always drill and tap larger to accept a Mig Welder tip. </strong></p>

                 <p><strong>Putting it together! I ended up using JB Weld on the sides to hold the "jet" straight down the pipe. </strong>

                 <p><strong>Assembly complete! Now for the actual forge...</strong></p>

                 <p><strong>bricks from the local wood stove repair shop. stacked ontop of some 1/4" steel plate that was laying around my boss's (at the time) warehouse.</strong> </p>

                 <p><strong>After some chisel work to create a burner Inlet, i tacked some steel supports to help hold it together. (not completely necassary btw, get creative!)</strong></p>

                 <img src="Dirt Cheap Forge/IMG_20200406_191834455.jpg"width="1180">

                 <p><strong>It seems to work!</strong></p>

                 <p><strong>Okay, it definitely works. </strong></p>

                 <P><strong>Hope you enjoyed and maybe even got some ideas for your next project! </strong></P>
